Project Log 

To-do list needs 

Local Storage 

A project section or seperate sections i.e. audit actions, near-misses and SHEQ actions 

Each card, should be a state object with a 
- title
- description
- duedate
- Priority 
- additonal can be catagorey e.g. audit, environemnt,accident,admin 

Additional extras could include filter by X, see a list of completed actions etc. 

First thoughts 

A factory function that accepts the state 
Use composition for assigning and building additional functionality 
Array of objects to stoere cards and ES6 destructure to assign values. 

Perhaps look at classes for pre-assigned options.
